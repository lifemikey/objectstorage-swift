# Add an Object (File) via the Portal

Adding an object (file) in the Customer Portal allows the user to upload files into the selected container associated with an Object Storage account. An unlimited number of files may be uploaded, but each file may not exceed 20 MB in size. Follow the steps below to add an object (file) to an Object Storage account.

## Add an Object

1. Access the Object Storage screen in the [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com/). Refer to [Access the Object Storage screen](access-object-storage-screen.html).
2. Click the **Add File** link.
3. Click the **Select box** in the pop-up to access the drives on your workstation.
4. Locate the file for upload and select the file.
5. Click the **Add** button to upload the selected file. Click **Cancel** to cancel the upload.

## What Happens Next

After uploading the file, it may be [accessed](access-object-folder-or-container.html) at any time. Additionally, it may be [edited](view-and-edit-object-storage-file-details.html) or [deleted](delete-object-cluster.html). To add additional details about the file within the Object Storage cluster without editing the file itself, [add meta data](add-and-edit-metadata-object.html) to the object.

Due to the portal upload's size limit of 20 MB, consider using other means to upload larger files. See instructions for [Connecting to Object Storage using the Command Line](connect-object-storage-using-command-line.html), [Connecting to Object Storage using Cyberduck](connect-object-storage-using-cyberduck.html) or [Connecting to Object Storage using WinSCP](connect-object-storage-using-winscp.html) for more information.
