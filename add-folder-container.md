# Add a Folder to a Container

Adding a folder in the [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com/) allows for organization of files that would ordinarily be placed directly in the container. Folders may be added to the container itself or to another folder to provide additional options for organization. The process for adding a folder directly to a container or adding a folder to another folder (nesting folders) is the same. Follow the steps below to add a folder.

## Add a Folder

1. Access the container. Refer to [Access and Exit a Container](access-and-exit-container.html).
2. Click the **Add Folder** link.
3. Enter the name of the new folder in the **Add New Folder** text box.
4. Click the **OK** button to create the folder. Click **Cancel** to cancel the action.

## What Happens Next

After adding a folder, [files may be added to the folder](add-object-file.html). At any time, a folder may be [deleted](delete-object-cluster.html) from a container or another folder.
