# Search within a Cluster

In addition to cluster, container and object interactions, a search may be across the entire cluster, regardless of what level of data is currently being viewed. Follow the steps below to search for information within an Object Storage cluster.

1. Access the Object Storage screen in the [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com/). Refer to [Access the Object Storage screen](access-object-storage-screen.html).
2. Enter the search term(s) in the Search field. <br/>
   **Note**: The Search field for Object Storage will be located on the middle of the screen, to the right of your current location within the cluster hierarchy.
3. Click the Search button.

## What Happens Next

The system will return all containers and objects that match the search criteria where files and containers are normally viewed.
