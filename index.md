# IBM Cloud Object Storage (Swift)

IBM Cloud Object Storage (Swift) is a redundant and scalable cloud storage service that allows users to easily store, search, and retrieve data across the Internet, with optional CDN connectivity, or across SoftLayerâ€™s global private network.  This is the original Object Storage that runs on Openstack swift. Formerly known as SoftLayer Object Storage.
