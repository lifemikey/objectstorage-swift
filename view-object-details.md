# Viewing an Object in {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} OpenStack Swift

After an object has been added, details regarding the object may be viewed at any time in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}. 

To view an object, click the checkbox next to the object you wish to view. The object details will appear in the pane to the right of the object list. 

When viewing folders, interactions are limited to deleting a folder and adding metadata. Files, however, have multiple actions that may be taken in regard to edits from the file view.
