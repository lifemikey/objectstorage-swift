# Accessing an Object in a Folder or Container

After adding an object, it can be accessed at any time from your {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} account. To access an object, simply click on the file or folder name. Files will be downloaded according browser settings, while folders will be opened to show an additional level of objects.
