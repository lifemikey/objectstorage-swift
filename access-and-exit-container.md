# Accessing and Exiting a Container

After a container is created, files and folders can be added and organized within the container. Before you can complete any task within a container, it must be accessed first. To complete a task within another container or directly in the cluster, the user must first exit the container. 


1. Access the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} screen on the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}.
2. Click the **Container Name** to access the container.
3. Click the **Cluster Name** to exit the container and return to the cluster.


Within a container, multiple actions can be taken on its folders or its objects (files). Folders can be [added](add-folder-container.html) and [viewed](access-object-folder-or-container.html), and files can be [added](add-object-file.html), [edited](view-and-edit-object-storage-file-details.html), and [deleted](delete-object-cluster.html). At any time after a container was [added](add-container-cluster.html), it can also be [deleted](delete-container.html).
