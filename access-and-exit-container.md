# Accessing and Exiting a Container

After a container has been created, files and folders can be added and organized with the container. Prior to completing any task within a container, it must first be accessed. To complete a task within another container or directly to the cluster, the user must first exit the container. Follow the steps below to access and exit a container.

## Access and Exit a Container

1. Access the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} screen on the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}. Refer to [Access the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} Screen](access-object-storage-screen.html).
2. Click the **Container Name** to access the container.
3. Click the **Cluster Name** to exit the container and return to the cluster.

## What Happens Next

Within a container, multiple actions may be taken on its folders or its objects (files). Folders may be [added](add-folder-container.html) and [viewed](access-object-folder-or-container.html), and files may be [added](add-object-file.html), [edited](view-and-edit-object-storage-file-details.html) and [deleted](delete-object-cluster.html). At any time after a container has been [added](add-container-cluster.html), it may also be [deleted](delete-container.html).
