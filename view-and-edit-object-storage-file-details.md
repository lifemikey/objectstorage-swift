## What Happens Next

The next actions are dependent upon the selections made using the previous steps. Generally, the selections will dictate the actions that are taken by the system on the file, however, when deleting a file, it cannot be retrieved. If a file was downloaded, it will generally be available within a location in your browser. Additional actions may be taken on the same file consecutively, so long as the file was not deleted.
